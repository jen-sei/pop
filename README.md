Research focused platform to demystify claims of privacy tooling on Ethereum. Proposed as additional and supporting body of web3privacy.info

## Problem
Public ledger ecosystems are posing a high risk towards an individual user privacy. 


This is mainly due to:
- de-anonymizing users
- governmental surveillance
- infringement of individual right-to-privacy

> "Not every privacy has been empowered equally." (Mykola Siusko, web3privacy now)

There is a plethora of projects that claims to be Decentralized, Privacy preserving, Anonymous... just to attract a "new" narrative-driven user base. Most of crypto users do not have te skills necessary or tools at hand to verify these claims.

This poses an additional threat stemming from trust in supposedly trust-less enviroments.

## Inspiration
This problem has been discussed with Mykola Siusko at the ETHDam 2023 Conference. It seemed 
as something of an interest and a potential strong benefit to the broad Ethereum ecosystem.


Looking at the L2BEAT.com platform and their “Risk Assessment” Analysis of individual Ethereum L2 scaling solution inspired me to suggest and showcase a proof-of-idea for how this problem can be visualized for easy consumption of researchers, crypto enthusiast, degens as well as crypto beginners.
