Research focused platform to demystify claims of privacy tooling on Ethereum. Proposed as additional and supporting body of web3privacy.info

## Problem
Public ledger ecosystems are posing a high risk towards an individual user privacy. 


This is mainly due to:
- de-anonymizing users
- governmental surveillance
- infringement of individual right-to-privacy

> "Not every privacy has been empowered equally." (Mykola Siusko, web3privacy now)

There is a plethora of projects that claims to be Decentralized, Privacy preserving, Anonymous... just to attract a "new" narrative-driven user base. Most of crypto users do not have te skills necessary or tools at hand to verify these claims.

This poses an additional threat stemming from trust in supposedly trust-less enviroments.

## Inspiration
This problem has been discussed with Mykola Siusko at the ETHDam 2023 Conference. It seemed 
as something of an interest and a potential strong benefit to the broad Ethereum ecosystem.


Looking at the L2BEAT.com platform and their “Risk Assessment” Analysis of individual Ethereum L2 scaling solution inspired me to suggest and showcase a proof-of-idea for how this problem can be visualized for easy consumption of researchers, crypto enthusiast, degens as well as crypto beginners.

### Solution

Demystifying privacy protocols, layers, application and tools would help to create awareness, safety for the users and would act as a knowledge repository for anyone interested to find relevant information on privacy tooling.

This can be added as an additional resource on the web3privacy.info [repo](https://github.com/web3privacy) / [website](https://web3privacy.info/)

## Method / Process
Starting as an privacy advocate initiative, via manual research by contributors; this concept can be further developed into a more decentrali&ed and democratic coordination as follows:

1. Propose a project to be assessed on a forum.
2. Community up-votes the projects.
3. The analysis of the most up-voted project is conducted by as many individual researchers as interested (work in a team).
4. Analysis result is showcased as proposal in the forum –> community participate in discussion.
5. A privacy advodate / researcher team adjust and prepares the final proposal.
6. The privacy risk assesment results are published via Guithub and on the Website.
7. Leaderboard is over time built.

## Vision
To create a collaborative and transparent platform that empowers the crypto community to assess and rank projects based on their privacy features.
